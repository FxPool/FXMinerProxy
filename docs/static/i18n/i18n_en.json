    "i18n.faq_item2-content": "This kind of problem is generally that the port is not open. If you buy a cloud server such as Ali, you need to first open the port security group in the backend of the cloud server. Open any port you want to use. You can also open all the ports in the range of 0-65535. Then if you still connect No, and if the system is Linux, the port of the server needs to be opened. The server can directly close the firewall. Use ufw disable (debian and unbantu systems).",
    "i18n.faq_item3-title": "Fee rate problem",
    "i18n.faq_item3-content": "Since the fee rate is dynamically calculated according to the share and difficulty, it may be very large when you start it up. Don’t worry, it will be close to the value you set after a long time, and it may be smaller than the value you set, but in general it will be close to the value you set. The actual situation still depends on the computing power of your pumping pool. The statistics of the pumping conversion rate of the chip machine will be slower than that of the graphics card. Usually it will be close to the value you set after running for 24 hours. The time is still subject to the mining pool",
    "i18n.faq_item4-title": "The problem of computing power of chip computer",
    "i18n.faq_item4-content": "Since the chip machine does not submit the computing power, fxminerproxy is dynamically calculated according to the difficulty, and it is calculated every 10 minutes, so the chip machine will have to wait 10 minutes before it can be displayed. The computing power is only for reference, and the specific mining pool shall prevail.",

    "i18n.faq_item6-content2": "FxminerProxy supports custom ports. Some friends often ask why they can only select from the drop-down menu and cannot enter it by themselves.

    "i18n.faq_item7-content": "Don't worry, after running for 10 minutes, the probability of this problem is very small, unless there is a problem with the server's acquisition time, it is common to use an international server, and the general method is to restart the software (setting interface).
